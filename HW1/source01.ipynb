    "# Homework 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework assignment is meant to revisit some concepts from linear algebra you have already encountered in the past. It is also designed to help you get accustomed with Jupyter and Python 3, if you don't know these already, and with the process required to submit your work on Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework Submission Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "When you submit your work, follow the instructions on the [submission workflow page](https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall18/compsci371d/homework/workflow.html) _**scrupulously**_ for full credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start, make sure you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) Python distribution, which contains essentially all of the code you will need for this course. Please do not use other installations of Python, and install the version for Python 3, not Python 2. Also, if you install new Python packages later on, do not mix package installation methods, unless you know very thoroughly what you are doing (for instance, do not use `pip` to install new software, only use `conda`). This will save you big headaches as the semester progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Editing a Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework assignments in this course, including this one, are made available as HTML files, which you can only read and print. A separate template file is also made available for each assignment. The template is a Jupyter notebook, a file called `homework0n.ipynb`, where `n` is the homework number. This is a file you can also edit, and will become the ntebook you submit for grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exception, for this first assignment you get the notebook `source01.ipynb` rather than the HTML file `assignment01.html`. In this way, you can also open `source01.ipynb` in the notebook editor and look at how this notebook was made. Once you are comfortable with notebook syntax, _**make sure you start from the template notebook**_ `homework01.ipynb`, _**not from the source notebook, to produce your submission.**_\n",
    "\n",
    "To edit a notebook, start the Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook from the Navigator. This will open a new page in your web browser with a listing of your home directory. Navigate to the directory where you put the files `source01.ipynb` and `homework01.ipynb` and click on each of them to open them. The files will open in the notebook editor in separate tabs of your web browser. _**Again, remember that**_ `source01.ipynb` _**is just for playing with, while**_ `homework01.ipynb` _**is the file you start from for your assignment.**_ \n",
    "\n",
    "To edit some text or code in either file, double-click on it. This will change the display of that _cell_ to edit mode. Try this now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A _cell_ is a block of content. There are a few different types of cell, but we will be concerned maily with `Markdown` cells and `Code` cells. The former contain text, including mathematics, and the latter contain snippets of code (Python 3 for us, although notebooks can deal with any programming language).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a `Markdown` cell, its contents are formatted and displayed. A `Markdown` cell can also contain straight HTML code. However, there won't be any need for this in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a `Code` cell, the code in it is executed in the current _kernel_, and any output from it is displayed after the cell. Any object created during execution (variables, function definitions,...) remains alive in the kernel, so you can assign a value to a variable in one cell and access it in a later cell. You can do various things to the kernel, such as restart it, interrupt it, and so forth. Please browse the `Kernel` menu at the top of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make, edit, delete, run, and do several other things to and with cells, you use the commands in the `Edit`, `View`, `Insert`, `Cell` menus. Look at these menus and try out some of the commands. The icons just below the menus are shortcuts for some of the more common commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Markdown` cells, all text except mathematics is formatted with _Markdown_ syntax, a simplified document annotation language. The mathematics is enclosed between dollar signs when it is inline with the text like the equation $\\frac{de^x}{dx} = e^x$, and between double dollar signs when it is displayed in the middle of a line on its own, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_0^{\\infty} e^{x} dx = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(look at the source of this text to see how this works). The easiest way to figure our how Markdown and LaTeX work is to look at the source of this notebook to see how text and math were composed, and how code was entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For your reference, here is [a list of Markdown syntax elements](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For your reference, here is [a list of LaTeX commands for mathematics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics)\n",
    "\n",
    "After you make changes to a cell, you can see the results of your changes by selecting `Cell->Run Cells` or `Cell->Run All`. The first command runs only the cell you are in, or the cells you select. The second command runs all the cells in the notebook. The `Run` button in the menu bar is a shortcut for `Cell->Run Cells`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting your Work\n",
    "\n",
    "To work on this assignment, open the HTML version `source01.html` of the assignment in one browser window, and open the notebook `homework01.ipynb` in the notebook editor (in another browser window) next to it. _**It is strongly recommended that you close**_ `source01.ipynb` to make sure you do not inadvertently put your work into that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work on `homework01.ipynb`, add as many cells as you need to answer the questions (use the `Insert->Cell Below` menu or the `+` icon in the menu bar). When you do so, make sure you select the proper cell type (`Markdown` for text, `Code` for Python code) from the menu, or else your formatting of text will not work, and your code will not run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the problems below involve coding, some do not.\n"

The function `show` takes `numpy` vectors `x` and `y`, which together represent a training set $T$, and a list `cList` of `numpy` vectors of polynomial coefficients. It then plots the training points as well as each polynomial in the list. For this problem, `x` and `y` contain a single number each, and `cList` contains the two vectors $\\mathbf{c}'$ and $\\mathbf{c}''$.

    "##### Programming Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder why the code above says `c.item(i)` rather than `c[i]`. The reason is that the latter version will not work when `nc`$=1$. In that case, `c` is what `numpy` calls a \"zero-dimensional array\", and therefore it expects zero subscripts, while the expression `c[i]` uses one subscript. The notation `c.item(i)` works even in that case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some may argue that this is a bug rather than a feature of the `numpy` package. While expecting a number of subscripts equal to the number of dimensions is a good concept, the behavior with zero-dimensional arrays often surprises programmers with unexpected error messages (`IndexError: too many indices for array`)."

    "Your code should also work when a single point is passed (so that `x.size` and `y.size` are equal to $N=1$). This corner case reveals another quirk of `numpy`. Specifically, the matrix $A$ in that case has a single row (and is possibly a single number if $k=0$ as well). However, `numpy.linalg.lstsq` expects its first argument to be a two-dimensional array, while we now have a zero- or one-dimensional array. This will raise an error when the function is called if you use `np.array` to hold your data.\n",

    "Instead, use `np.matrix`, which distinguishes between row vectors and column vectors, and handles low-dimensional matrices more gracefully for linear algebra applications. We pass `np.array` arguments to `fit` because these are the more commonly used containers and are more convenient to use in several ways.
